## Key Features

- **Proactive Ticket Creation**: The AI automatically detects user frustration or unresolved issues and creates a support ticket, ensuring no query is lost.
- **ReAct-Based RAG**: Utilizes an advanced ReAct (Reason + Act) model, allowing the AI to perform targeted searches against a vector database to find the most relevant information before answering.
- **Full Conversation Context**: Both user-initiated and AI-initiated tickets automatically capture the complete chat history, providing support agents with the full context needed for resolution.
- **Dynamic AI-Generated Greetings**: The chat experience is enhanced with unique, AI-generated welcome messages for each new session.
- **Markdown Support**: The frontend correctly renders Markdown, allowing for richly formatted AI responses including lists, bolding, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js and npm
- A Gemini API Key

### Backend Setup

1.  **Set API Key**: Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4.  **Build the Vector Database**:
    ```bash
    python3 build_vector_db.py
    ```

5.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install the required npm packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the React development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

1.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  Use the chat interface to ask a question. The AI will use its ReAct logic to find an answer.
3.  If you are unsatisfied, you can either click the "ðŸ‘Ž" button or express frustration directly. The system will create a ticket.
4.  You can view all created tickets by clicking the "View Tickets" link.
